# AVERAGE-OF-NUMBERS

C Program will take the total count for the numbers for which we want to calculate the average.

 After taking the count, We have to give the number to calculate the average.

 Here we are considering input value as Integer and output may be an integer or float value.
 Average is a mathematical calculation that can be obtained by the sum of numbers divided by the total count of the numbers.
 
 Suppose we want to calculate the Average of 1,2,3,4,5

So, first, find the sum of all numbers

1+2+3+4+5 = 15

And here total count for the numbers is 5.

So Average will be 15/5 = 3
